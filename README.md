# Nextstrain Builds for the Genomic Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Puerto Rico
SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Puerto Rico analyzed against a diverse set of genomes from the globe to provide phylogenetic context. These results are provided as heuristic guides only, based on literature review and phylogenetic analysis. Relationships between variants must be determined in conjunction with clinical, microbiological, and epidemiological information.
