# Genomic Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in Puerto Rico
This public repository analyzes SARS-CoV-2 genomes using the [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/) platform to understand how the virus that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, evolves and spreads in Puerto Rico. By reconstructing a phylogeny we can learn about important epidemiological phenomena such as spatial spread, introduction timings and epidemic growth rate.

We maintain two publicly-available builds and a narrative, accesible at the [Nextstrain community site](https://nextstrain.org/community/arodzh-sudo/ncov-puertorico/) that incorporates [recent changes](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/pull/910) made by the Nextstrain team which splits the phylogeny into a [six-months](https://nextstrain.org/community/arodzh-sudo/ncov-puertorico/Puerto-Rico/six-months/?branchLabel=emerging_lineage&f_country=Puerto%20Rico&m=div) build that focus subsampling on the past six months and an [all-time](https://nextstrain.org/community/arodzh-sudo/ncov-puertorico/Puerto-Rico/all-time?branchLabel=emerging_lineage&f_country=Puerto%20Rico&m=div) build that subsamples evenly across time. The original ncov code from the Nextstrain team is available [here](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov).
