This analysis focuses on genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Puerto Rico with additional sequences from North America selected by genetic similarity. Genomic sequences used in this analysis are obtained from [GISAID](https://gisaid.org) and remain subject to GISAIDâ€™s [Terms and Conditions](https://www.gisaid.org/registration/terms-of-use/). We gratefully acknowledge the authors, originating and submitting laboratories of the genetic sequences and metadata made available through [GISAID](https://gisaid.org). A full listing of all originating and submitting laboratories is available below. An attribution table is available by clicking on "Download Data" at the bottom of the page and then clicking on "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS" in the resulting dialog box.

We maintain (updated weekly) two publicly-available builds, accesible at the [Nextstrain community site](https://nextstrain.org/community/arodzh-sudo/ncov-puertorico/) that incorporates [recent changes](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/pull/910) made by the Nextstrain team which splits the phylogeny into a [six-months](https://nextstrain.org/community/arodzh-sudo/ncov-puertorico/Puerto-Rico/six-months/?branchLabel=emerging_lineage&f_country=Puerto%20Rico&m=div) build that focus subsampling on the past six months and an [all-time](https://nextstrain.org/community/arodzh-sudo/ncov-puertorico/Puerto-Rico/all-time?branchLabel=emerging_lineage&f_country=Puerto%20Rico&m=div) build that subsamples evenly across time. The original ncov code from the Nextstrain team is available [here](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov).
